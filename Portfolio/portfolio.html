					<p>
					I am a recent graduate from UNC Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Chemistry (Biochemistry track). My graduating GPA is 3.06 and I made the Dean's list in 2016.
					</p><p id="goal">
					My ultimate career goal is to combine my background in chemistry with my coding skills through Bioinformatics. While I'm still many years away from getting there, I hope one day to help develop a way of virtually testing drugs without the risk associated with human testing. 
					</p><p>
					I also play piano, primarily focusing on improvisational classical and new age styles. If you're interested, you can see some of my original compositions below.

					<p>
					During my time at UNC, I had the pleasure of working in many different lab environments. I learned to use spectrophotometry, agarose gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE, NMR spectroscopy, GC-MS, PCR, and other means of analyzing organic and biochemical reactions. With these techniques and others, I was taught to carry out tasks such as planning or executing complex syntheses and making genetic modifications to bacteria.
					</p><p>
					In addition, I have a strong computational background. I am a self-taught web and iOS developer, which is how I supported myself during my time at UNC. In the academic world, I have modelled complex molecular systems. Most notably, I was part of a team that created a model for disorder and anisotropy in third and fourth dimensional systems, which can be seen below.

						I worked as part of a four person team to model the effects of disorder and anisotropy on cubic lattices. My primary role was to create the model needed to run the tests. This model outputted a Hamiltonian matrix, shown in the first figure <span class="borr">to the right</span>.
						</p><p>
						The Hamiltonian could then be used to construct a set of molecular orbital energy levels, shown in the second figure. From the spacing patterns of the orbitals, conclusions could be made about the effect of the modelled disorder and anisotropy. For example, the irregularity of the spacing in the figure shown demonstrates that anisotropy reduces the conductance of the lattice. Other tests were also run, and the full presentation of these findings can be seen <a href="Disorder in Lattices.pptx" target="_blank" role="button">here</a>.
						</p><p>
						One of the most interesting, unanticipated results was that the pattern exhibited by the Hamiltonian made it possible to create a robust model for a theoretical fourth dimensional lattice. This lattice had fairly similar behavior, albeit with a greater number of energy levels and an exponentially larger Hamiltonian matrix.

					<p>
						Dear Sir or Madam,
						<br><br>
						It is my pleasure to serve as a reference for Nicholas Webb. Nicholas was an undergraduate student in a course I taught during the fall of 2016, Physical Chemistry II. This course, which is an introduction to molecular quantum mechanics, is one of the most difficult in our sequence. Nicholas’ performance on exams demonstrated mastery of traditional topics (e.g., electronic structure of atoms, diatomic molecules, etc). I was most impressed by the independent project he pursued for the course. Nicholas used Matlab to simulate electronic structures of graphene sheets.
						<br><br>
						In summary, Nicholas is one the brightest stars to have graduated from the chemistry program at UNC. He will be a tremendous success anywhere he goes.

					<p>
						I was Nicholas's supervisor in our Chemistry Tutorial Center last year.  He was among our best tutors.  He's very relaxed and approachable... while at the same time quite intelligent.  He is also 100% reliable.

					<p>
						We hired Nicholas as a contract employee to help set up a laboratory to process / sample sediment cores received from a project site. The processing required great attention to details and strict adherence to protocols. Nicholas undertook the tasks assigned with patience and a good attitude. He demonstrated the appropriate level of detail to assigned tasks and contributed suggestions as to how make the progress more efficient.  The laboratory work environment required Nicholas to work in tight quarters with a team of laboratory technicians; none of whom knew each other. Nicholas demonstrated the ability to work in a team environment.

					<h3 class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Dr. Sue Scarlett</h3><hr>
					<p>
						As a family friend of Nicholas Webb, I have borne witness to his academic and personal growth over the past 9 years throughout his high school and university studies. Nicholas is gifted academically as well as technically and musically. Equally if not more importantly, he is an individual, in every sense of the word, of the highest caliber of ethics and logic.
						<br>
						Nicholas seeks to educate and develop himself both formally and informally to achieve his own standard of achievement and career preparation. His BS degree in chemistry from The University of North Carolina Chapel Hill is part of this preparation as well as his self-taught endeavors in web and iOS development. His talents of composing and improvising music, although they don`t directly prepare him for his career, attest to his creative nature and his ability to anticipate and adapt.
						<br>
						In summary, Nicholas Webb is an extremely strong candidate for any position that requires a bright, logical, ethical, creative worker. A more stable, intelligent candidate will be hard to come by.

If you have any positions available that will be starting around that time, I would be interested in learning more.
