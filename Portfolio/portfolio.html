					<p>
					I am a recent graduate from UNC Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Chemistry (Biochemistry track). My graduating GPA is 3.06 and I made the Dean's list in 2016.
					</p><p id="goal">
					My ultimate career goal is to combine my background in chemistry with my coding skills through Bioinformatics. While I'm still many years away from getting there, I hope one day to help develop a way of virtually testing drugs without the risk associated with human testing. 
					</p><p>
					I also play piano, primarily focusing on improvisational classical and new age styles. If you're interested, you can see some of my original compositions below.

					<p>
					During my time at UNC, I had the pleasure of working in many different lab environments. I learned to use spectrophotometry, agarose gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE, NMR spectroscopy, GC-MS, PCR, and other means of analyzing organic and biochemical reactions. With these techniques and others, I was taught to carry out tasks such as planning or executing complex syntheses and making genetic modifications to bacteria.
					</p><p>
					In addition, I have a strong computational background. I am a self-taught web and iOS developer, which is how I supported myself during my time at UNC. In the academic world, I have modelled complex molecular systems. Most notably, I was part of a team that created a model for disorder and anisotropy in third and fourth dimensional systems, which can be seen below.

						I worked as part of a four person team to model the effects of disorder and anisotropy on cubic lattices. My primary role was to create the model needed to run the tests. This model outputted a Hamiltonian matrix, shown in the first figure <span class="borr">to the right</span>.
						</p><p>
						The Hamiltonian could then be used to construct a set of molecular orbital energy levels, shown in the second figure. From the spacing patterns of the orbitals, conclusions could be made about the effect of the modelled disorder and anisotropy. For example, the irregularity of the spacing in the figure shown demonstrates that anisotropy reduces the conductance of the lattice. Other tests were also run, and the full presentation of these findings can be seen <a href="Disorder in Lattices.pptx" target="_blank" role="button">here</a>.
						</p><p>
						One of the most interesting, unanticipated results was that the pattern exhibited by the Hamiltonian made it possible to create a robust model for a theoretical fourth dimensional lattice. This lattice exhibitted fairly similar behavior, albeit with a greater number of energy levels and an exponentionally larger Hamiltonian matrix.

					My work as a developer has primarily been focused on lockscreens, widgets, and other useful tweaks for jailbroken iPhones. I began as a self-taught coder in 2014, and have been constantly working to improve my skill and create new, unique things.

					You can see a review by Youtuber Jima6636 of the first thing I made

					I have been playing paino for ten years. During that time, I have honed my skills of composition and improvisation. These skills have translated well into my other work, improving my ability to think quickly and find creative solutions.

					Widget Assistant, my most recent project, displays important information right on your iPhone's homescreen by rotating through 3 screens. 
					The first shows the weather, the second shows the clock, battery, ram, and calendar, while the third shows your notifications.
					</p><p>
					The full version is completely customizable, allowing you to change the animation style, colors, and language. Click on the links below to see product reviews that give a more in-depth look at Widget Assistant. You can also click on the iPhone screen <span id="below"></span> to get a closer look.
